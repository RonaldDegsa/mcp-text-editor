## Potential Reasons for Failures

*   **Fixture Failures:** Tests are failing due to fixture issues (`test_dir`, `test_file`, `test_invalid_encoding_file`). Ensure that the temporary directories and files are being created correctly and that the test environment has the necessary permissions.
*   **Hash Mismatch:** Several tests fail due to hash mismatches. Ensure that the file content and hash calculation logic are consistent.
*   **Range Handling:** Tests related to range handling (invalid ranges, overlapping ranges, out-of-range) are failing. Review the range validation logic in the code.
*   **Error Handling:** Tests related to error handling (file not found, IO errors, invalid encoding) are failing. Ensure that the error handling logic is correctly implemented and that appropriate hints and suggestions are provided.
*   **Logic Errors:** Some tests may be failing due to logic errors in the core functionality of the text editor. Review the code and ensure that it is correctly implemented.
